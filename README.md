# ScriptManager

Very tiny (but usefull) library to manage Lua script

It depends on Lua and Selene

Read the main.cpp to see the actual features

I have some ideas about anothers features and a lot of improvements with classes and objects. Also I would like to implement "Libraries" to use common functions.

- [Lua](http://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/) : The Lua website to get binaries/source
- [Selene](https://github.com/jeremyong/Selene) : The C++ binding I use (which is awesome)
- [EliasDaler](https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/using-lua-with-cpp-luabridge/) : Good website about stuff with C++/Lua
